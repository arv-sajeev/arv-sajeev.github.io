# Hello world! 

The original intention for this website is to serve as my blog, I've always wanted one. 
I don't actually care if nobody reads it which probably will be the case, but if you're reading this, 
I'd like to thank you for your time and pity you for your lack of other engagements.

I consider this sort of my diary/immortality project. I assume github is not gonna take down my repo until they run out of namespace, 
shutdown the company or the armageddon each less likely than the last, so I guess this is gonna stay here for a while. 
The idea has been in mind since the start of the Corona lockdown of 2020 but I never really got to doing anything. 
Skip ahead months in and I finally lifted my sorry ass and got to work. I don't plan to stick to any specific topic or even screen my posts for quality, 
just consider what you see here as rants of mine and nothing more. I guess tagging posts would be a good idea I'll try to get something of that sort set up.

The main aim is to set this site up with the tool [statim](https://github.com/arv-sajeev/statim), which is a tool I'm working on and will hopefully complete. 
It is intended to be a lightweight static site generator with minimum dependencies, using only bash scripts and tools already available in the linux ecosystem. 
The idea is not originally my own but of a young colleague of a friend of mine who goes by the name NerdyPeppers. 
It seemed to be a good idea and here is my spin on it. The site design as such took next to no work, the wonderful and ever helpful people at w3-schools had a free template, 
I just tweaked it a bit here and there and the results are much better than I expected, that being said I learned quite a lot about html and css on the way.

I put quite a lot of effort to reach till here, so I hope that I'll carry on with the same or at least comparable enthusiasm. The tool is quite hackey and needs a whole load of improvements,
if you have any ideas please do contact me, I'd love to hear from you.
