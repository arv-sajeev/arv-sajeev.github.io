# Sample blog post

Write your posts in markdown and run the build command in the project directory the files 
built will be placed in the build directory. You can tag posts when creating them and they'll
be filled in the tags page and will have links to related posts in the posts page. The post 
should also have the chronologically next post in the entire blog as a next post in the 
and previous post as well. 

This is the aim lets see if we reach there :).
